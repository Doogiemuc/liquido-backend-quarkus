# These are the next todos I am planning for LIQUIDO

 * Update to Quarkus v3.30.x - or can I stay with the v27.0.0 LTS = long-term-support(!) https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/wiki/Migration-Guide-3.30
 * Native Build of docker container (started)
 * Checkout all the //TODO annotations in the code
 * Checkout Quarkus SimpleScheduler for cleanup operations in the background.
 * Make sure that a "human" can only register once: webauthn
 * Prevent loops in delegation chain!
